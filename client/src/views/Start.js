          The role titles (including the numerics) are for you and your manager
          to keep track of your progress internally, but you are free to use
          anything sensible for your outward facing title (e.g. conference
          talks, LinkedIn). Determining when to progress from one role to the
          next is a discussion that should happen between you and your manager.
          As a general guide, performing a significant percentage of the
          responsibilities of the next role for 3-6 months would indicate
          readiness to step into that role.
